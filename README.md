# Pathways-Project
Passion project that I've been working on. It is still a work in progress but allows me the 
opportunity to apply neurology research through an AI. In this project we are working on a 
hiring system that is more UX-centric meaning the developers in the hiring process should 
actually enjoy the process itself while delivering on key business objectives such as employee
success, development, and job performance. 


Requires a seperate repository: 'pathways-api' which I have not uploaded for privacy/
security reasons.
